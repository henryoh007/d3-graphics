d3-graphics
===========

As you can see, this repository contains a *massive* number of code samples (think "swatches"), with many similar variations, that illustrate how to create D3-based graphics effects using polar equations.

Please keep in mind that the code samples in this repository are for entertainment, and they do not necessarily contain "best practices", nor are they intended for a production website.

In case you're interested, the following repository contains "pure" SVG graphics (similar to some of the code samples in this repository) created with Polymer:
```

```
These  repositories contain code samples with SVG and the Web Animations API:
```
https://github.com/ocampesato/web-animations
https://github.com/ocampesato/web-animations-gestures
https://github.com/ocampesato/web-animations-transforms
```
Some of my other repositories use AngularJS, Famo.us, and ReactJS to create SVG-based graphics.
