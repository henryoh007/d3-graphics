d3-graphics
===========

As you can see, this repository contains a *massive* number of code samples (think "swatches"), with many similar variations, that illustrate how to create D3-based graphics effects using polar equations.

Please keep in mind that the code samples in this repository are for entertainment, and they do not necessarily contain "best practices", nor are they intended for a production website.

Enjoy!
